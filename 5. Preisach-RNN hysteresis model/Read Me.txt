Instructions:

1. Run data_prep to extract, transform data
2. Run train_RNN_minor_major_loops to train RNN -> warning: this takes 36 hours to train 100 networks under the current settings
3. Run evaluate_trained_neural_network_and_plot to choose the best network, plot signals and calculate performance and sensitivity analysis. A trained and processed example is provided so that you can run this file.

IMPORTANT note: One ramp rate value from set 2 is MISSING due to an upload limit of 25MB per file. Send an email to chrisgre23@gmail.com to request these files.
